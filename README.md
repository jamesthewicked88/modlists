Introduction 

Project Liberation overhauls all parts of 2077 into another DLC like 2.0 Update using 1,200+ mods. You will see massive improvements in visuals, brutal game play action, a responsive and lively NC, new means to make eddies, over a 120 added cars and weapons each, and a very customizable V. All lore friendly with the cyberpunk/edgerunners/bladerunner aesthetic in mind. still.


Frameworks & Baseline Mods

Has a complete base of mods that will support all aspects of modding from CET, RED4ext, ArchiveXL, TweakXL, REDscript, RedData, RedhttpClient, RedFileSystem, Codeware, AudioWare and more. This is a great start and allows you to add most mods.


Visuals & Graphics & Lighting

The visuals have been greatly enhanced with Ultraplus+ v7.4 with LOD mods and Improved Textures to almost everything and everyone in the city with drastic lighting overhaul
changes to choose from. Not So Good Draw Distance, Faster Rainmap & Distance Shadows, with Clear Windows makes the Night City feel vibrant. Enhancing almost all textures in game with Cyberpunk 2077 HD Rework Project Balanced, Environment Texture Overhaul 2k, with High Quality Ads, Better Ad Draw Distance Night City actually feels like a Neon Metropolis. Paired with Nova City 2, ReLux Terminals, LuT Switcher 2 and almost every pack – you can make the vibe of Night City truly yours with little effort. Add a reshade on top of it all if your PC can handle it for truly life like graphics.


Combat & NCPD & City Gangs

Combat has been elevated & refined, more cyberware, chromed out enemies, intense NCPD pursuits – now with a wrap sheet and fines to pay off - also beware of gangs as they are equally as chromed out and can call reinforcements and remember who you are and what you've done. You'll need to manually reload, feel the immersive hit of being shot, take the stealthrunner approach and much more overhauls to combat. NCPD will not to be bothered to pursue minor crimes and acts of violence, but NCPD will take and
file a report and fine you, fellow NC residents can call in and report your actions as well. Let this go on for too long and the NCPD will recognize and pursuit you. After shaking off the pursuit you will have a "soft star" wanted level. This means the police will recognize you more quickly and keep the same wanted stars until you lay low long enough or get outta town. Of course if you go Cyberpsycho after enough mayhem an automatic 3 start and light Maxtac team will be called to your location. Gangs will fight in the streets more often and will call in back up when battling one another. They are chromed out with cyberware and netrunners in their ranks to keep you on your toes. They will now remember you and your actions against their crew and may just right out shoot and pursue V, after time they will become less hostile. Be aware of your ride and clothing, steal a car and cover your face to minimize the effects with NCDP and gangs.


Metro & Vehicles & Fashion

Need to get around town after the opener – well fast travel will cost ya, the metro is always a cheap and preem option now with an option to route, enter, and quickly ride
the Metro. Once you start making a name for yourself take a look online at the new Auto Dealer with over 120+ vehicles to choose from(pricing tbd). Not only nice rides, but even more clothes, cyberware, and tactical armor for both Male and Female V so both sexes feel like they have many options and styles to choose from. Do expect delivery times for vary for clothing and weapons purchased you can get priority shipping for more eddies choom.


V-isuals

All skin textures have been enhanced. Both V's have many more unique hairstyles, eyes, and colors to choose from using CCXL. I have added in extra cyberware and changed stock game tattoos a little. As of now neither V has a modded body or framework for tattoos and other things. I just started using photomode so I will explore this more. But this is a strong base to start with for most users.


Romance

Explore the City with your chosen partner in-game with dancing, drinks, or just staying in at one of all the remodels apartments. Feel free to look for more relationships or flexible relationships at given moments in game.
