Introduction

Project Liberation overhauls all parts of 2077 into another DLC like 2.0
Update using 1,200+ mods. You will see massive improvements in visuals, brutal game play action, a responsive and lively NC, new means to make eddies, over a 120 added cars and weapons each. New cyberware and a very customizable V. All lore friendly with the cyberpunk/edgerunners/bladerunner aesthetic in mind.


Frameworks & Baseline Mods

Has a complete base of mods that will support all aspects of modding from Cyber Engine Tweaks, RED4ext, ArchiveXL, TweakXL, REDscript, RedData, RedhttpClient,
RedFileSystem, Codeware, AudioWare and more. This is a great start and allows you to add most mods.


Visuals & Graphics & Lighting

The visuals have been greatly enhanced with Ultraplus+ v7.4 with LOD mods and Improved Textures to almost everything and everyone in the city with drastic lighting overhaul changes to choose from. Not So Good Draw Distance, Faster Rainmap & Distance Shadows, with Clear Windows makes the Night City feel vibrant. Enhancing almost all textures in game with Cyberpunk 2077 HD Rework Project Balanced, Environment Texture Overhaul 2k, with High Quality Ads, Better Ad Draw Distance Night City actually feels like a Neon Metropolis. Paired with Nova City 2, ReLux Terminals, LuT Switcher 2 and almost every pack – you can make the vibe of Night City truly yours with little effort. Add a reshade on top of it all if your PC can handle it for truly life like graphics.


Immersion & City Changes

Manage V's basic needs with sleep, hunger, and hydration playing a light role in overall game-play. Ignore these and things like small health debuffs, slow stamina regeneration, and other small things effecting V's skills. Trying to scale the cost of apartments, cars, and cyberware accordingly to game progression. Most all locations, areas, and regions have been modded that allow it without game-play bugs and issues WIP. Just a small example now if you head to Rocky Ridge you'll find a much more developed town before the final resting spot of the Aldecaldo family. Find many different ways to make eddies now through out night city. Drive a taxi, be a shipment driver, or a top earning joy toy doll. You can always do things more gray in nature. Hacking machines for eddies, knock out citizen and mug them, taking down random cyberpsychos that spawn through out game-play. When you have earned enough eddies open a bank account & check out the new purchasable mansions, houses, apartments, and safe-houses. But be sure to keep the income rolling, rents always due choom, no eddies, eviction time. Or if you're a savant check out the stock market and trades try your luck at having you eddies work for you. Hit it big and start buying up business fronts all over night city for a passive income while you work on building up your reputation to a legend of the city.  

Combat & NCPD & City Gangs

Combat has been elevated & refined, more cyberware, chromed out enemies, intense NCPD pursuits – now with a wrap sheet and fines to pay off - also beware of gangs as they are equally as chromed out and can call reinforcements and remember who you are and what you've done. You'll need to manually reload, feel the immersive hit of being shot, use all weapons with vehicles, take the stealthrunner approach, try out new attachments and cyberdecks that allow you to craft droids and armored units, cyberware lenses for HUD displays, and more overhauls to combat. NCPD will not be bothered to pursue minor crimes and acts of violence, but NCPD will take and file a report and fine you, fellow NC residents can call in and report your actions as well. Let this go on for too long and the NCPD will recognize and pursuit you. After shaking off the pursuit you will have a "soft star" wanted level. This means the police will recognize you more quickly and keep the same wanted stars until you lay low long enough or get outta town. Of course if you go cyberpsycho after enough mayhem an automatic 3 will start and a light Maxtac Assault  team will be called to your location. Gangs will fight in the streets more often and will call in back up when battling one another. Citizen will get into disputes with one another don't be surprised it's only gun violence. Gangs and Corporations are chromed out with cyberware and netrunners in their ranks to keep you on your toes. They will now remember your actions against them and may just right out shoot and pursue V, after time (72 hrs+) they will become less hostile. Be aware of your ride and clothing, steal a car and cover your face to minimize the effects with NCDP and gangs.


Metro & Vehicles & Fashion

Need to get around town after the opener – well fast travel will cost ya, the metro is always a cheap and preem option now with an option to route, enter platforms, and quickly ride the Metro. Once you start making a name for yourself take a look online at the new Auto Dealer with over 120+ vehicles to choose from(pricing tbd). Close to City Center you will now be able to visit the Deka Auto Dealership in person to check out the stock on the show room floor. Now cars cost $$$$, gas averages $100 eddies per gallon (custom map icons), also with repair shops and upgrade shops. Places to upgrade you car are the H10 Megabuilding Parking Ramp, Badlands Fuel Station South on the way to Yucca, Badlands Dakotas Garage, and Northside Waston district. The rest of the wrenches on the map allow you to repair your damage vehicle, simply pull up get out, talk to the vendor, pay the fee. All vehicle handling has been overhauled starting with Cyber Drift 2.0 with 7 more mods to change cars to handle and drift with ease with improved realism. Drive an Aerial vehicle is installed for about 5+ flying models. El Capitan will eventually set your ride up with NOS..... Zoom Choom.  Not only nice rides online, but even more clothes, cyberware, and tactical armor for both Male and Female V so both sexes feel like they have many options and styles to choose from. These are lore friendly and appropriate clothing (no goon here).  Do expect delivery times to vary for clothing and weapons purchased you can get priority shipping for more eddies choom.


Vincent & Valerie

All skin textures have been enhanced. Both V's have many more unique hairstyles, eyes, and colors to choose from using CCXL. I have added in extra cyberware and changed stock game tattoos a little. As of now neither V has the vanilla 2077 body, I will most likely stick with this given all the clothes and some do not offer other framework support. I just started using photomode so I will explore this more. But this is a strong base to start with for most users.


Romance

Explore the City with your chosen partner in-game with dancing, drinks, or just staying in at one of all the remodels apartments. Feel free to look for more relationships or flexible relationships at given moments in game.
